Description: The functions defined in this program serve for implementing adaptive
    two-stage tests. Currently, four tests are included: Bauer and Koehne (1994),
    Lehmacher and Wassmer (1999), Vandemeulebroecke (2006), and the horizontal conditional
    error function. User-defined tests can also be implemented. Reference: Vandemeulebroecke,
